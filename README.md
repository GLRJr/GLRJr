### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Full Stack Software Engineer based in Los Angeles, California. I started my career as a Aviation Electronics/ Propulsion Technician and soon my love of hardware developed into a love of software.

Having a background in Areospace, I spent all my time working with machines and now I get to work with people. I enjoy developing software because I've seen the amazing things we can acomplish with technology. I am looking forward to collaborating with other engineers and designers to build things people love.
